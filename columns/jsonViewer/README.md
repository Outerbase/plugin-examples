# JSON Viewer

This is a web component that lets you interact with JSON data in Outerbase! It is powered by `npm` and allows you to bundle your code into a singular file which you can then upload to Outerbases marketplace.

## Getting Started
Ensure you install all of the latest packages we have using `npm ci`. You have the ability to use `npm run build` which will bundle `index.js` into one file at `/dist/jsonViewer.js`. You can take the code there and upload it to Outerbase and test your new column plugin there!
